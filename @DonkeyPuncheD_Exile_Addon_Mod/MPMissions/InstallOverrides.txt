How to use the override included
Move the overrides folder into your mission file
Find this class cfg and add the code that looks like this:
	//BUILDING <---HERE
	ExileClient_gui_hud_event_onKeyUp = "overrides\ExileClient_gui_hud_event_onKeyUp.sqf";

class CfgExileCustomCode 
{
	/*
		You can overwrite every single file of our code without touching it.
		To do that, add the function name you want to overwrite plus the 
		path to your custom file here. If you wonder how this works, have a
		look at our bootstrap/fn_preInit.sqf function.

		Simply add the following scheme here:

		<Function Name of Exile> = "<New File Name>";

		Example:

		ExileClient_util_fusRoDah = "myaddon\myfunction.sqf";
	*/	
	//BUILDING <---HERE
	ExileClient_gui_hud_event_onKeyUp = "overrides\ExileClient_gui_hud_event_onKeyUp.sqf";
};
if you have no other overrides your class CfgExileCustomCode will look like it does here, if you have overrides just add the code to it :)
