These are the reloading sounds for the weapons (Apex). They are separated from the main mod as these tend to cause trouble on the servers. 

There are Dummy Server Side files for the public server support that might fix the problems. 

If the reloading sounds aren't allowed on a server, you can delete the DragonFyre_ReloadingSounds/Apex to join.
